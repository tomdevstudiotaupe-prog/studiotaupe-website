                        <div class="about-more" style="display:none;">
                            <p class="about-text">My journey into photography began thanks to my sister. She sparked the realisation that every image we see â€” in magazines, ads or shop windows â€” was once created by someone, with care and intention. That idea stuck with me. Years later, I turned that curiosity into a craft.</p>
                            <p class="about-text">I have a deep sense of style and a passion for visual design, which I also studied. I love the details â€” the way light moves, the precision of a sharp focus, the softness of skin tones, the balance of clean composition. My approach is thoughtful, minimal and intentional, with space for natural presence to come through.</p>
                            <p class="about-text">I'm also a huge tech enthusiast and love exploring new tools and creative technologies. Together with Tom, who codes and builds, we make the perfect team: I bring the vision, style and design, he brings the code and technical magic.</p>
                            <p class="about-text">When I'm not behind the camera, you'll find me making coffee. I'm a home barista and love to create a lovely cappuccino with latte art at home. It's often the small, quiet rituals that shape how I work.</p>

                    <p class="about-role">Developer & Production Manager</p>
                    <div class="about-accordion">
                        <p class="about-text">Back on April 3rd, 2013, I already tried to build something. I was just 15 years old at the time, full of ideas but without the knowledge to finish it.</p>
                        <div class="about-more" style="display:none;">
                            <p class="about-text">Now, almost twelve years later and at age 27, I finally made it happen! ðŸ’ª</p>
                            <p class="about-text">I grew up surrounded by technology â€” my father was an IT manager, so I was always interested in tech. I've been watching Apple Events since 2009 and was born in 1997. I've always had so many ideas, but never the skills to build them.</p>
                            <p class="about-text">I studied IT at Deltion College, where I was ranked 2nd in the Netherlands at the time. Although I didn't finish the program after my second year, I kept learning on my own, often late into the night. Over the years, I taught myself to code and finally turned my ideas into real products.</p>
                            <p class="about-text">Today, I combine my passion for technology, Apple, and design to create digital products that are both beautiful and functional. I'm also the production manager at our main company, Studio Taupe, where I make sure every shoot and project runs smoothly from start to finish. I believe in lifelong learning, curiosity, and building things that make a difference.</p>
